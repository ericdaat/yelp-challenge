# Yelp Data Challenge

You can grab the data from Yelp by visiting [this](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge) page

I am going to be using Python programming language, along with a couple libraries that you can find in [this requirements file](requirements.txt). I chose to use a virtual environment as it is cleaner and easier to manage libraries.
